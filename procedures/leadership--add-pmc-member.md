Adding a new PMC Member
=======================

When a mew PMC member is added to the team, there are a number of places they
need to be included, and things that need to be udpated, as follows:

1) Update the leadership page backdropcms.org/leadership so that everybody knows
   that they are a part of the team.

2) Add the new person to the backdrop-ops/pmc repository, so that they can have
   access to all the PMC issues.

3) Add the new person to the backdrop-ops/leadership repository, so that they
   can have access to all the issues where PMC + Core committers collaborate.

4) Add the person's preferred email address to the pmc member group email
   forwarding, set up at NameCheap.

5) Add the new PMC member as a signatory on the fiscal sponsorship agreement
   between Backdrop CMS and the Software Freedom Conservancy.

6) (Until we choose a better chat tool that integrates with GitHub)
   5a) Manually add the PMC member to the private "PMC" chat channel.
   5b) Manually add the PMC member to the private "Leadership" chat channel.
