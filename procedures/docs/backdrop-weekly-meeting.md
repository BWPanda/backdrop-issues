Link to this document: http://bit.ly/1UvUEKY

## Are you qualified to run a meeting?

* Are you comfortable guiding your friends and colleagues through an agenda?
* Are you at least a  little bit passionate about Backdrop CMS?

If you said yes to both of these questions, then yes, you are qualified to run a meeting!

## What do you need to have access to?

* You will need access to the Backdrop CMS google account
  - All agendas are located in our [Agendas folder on Google Drive](http://bit.ly/2sZbS8l)
  - All meetings are managed through [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com)
* You will need a GitHub account to access [Gitter.im](https://gitter.im/backdrop/backdrop-issues)


## Before you can run a weekly meeting:

* Test that you can log in to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com) as Backdrop CMS
* Test that you see the "Start hangout on air" button on the [YouTube event list](https://www.youtube.com/my_live_events)

## Steps required for running a weekly meeting:

1. Locate the meeting agenda
   * it's located in our [Agendas folder on Google Drive](http://bit.ly/2sZbS8l)
   * it's also usually been [tweeted](https://twitter.com/backdropcms) in advance of the meeting

1. (Optional) Update the meeting agenda
   * add anything new & exciting
   * remove anything you are not comfortable talking about

1. Visit the [YouTube meeting list](https://www.youtube.com/my_live_events)

1. Start the meeting by clicking the “Start hangout on air” button for the appropriate meeting.

1. Post a link to join the meeting into the backdrop channels for [Gitter.im](https://gitter.im/backdrop/backdrop-issues)
   * Copy the URL for the hangout
   * Remove the ?eid=whatever from the end of the URL
   * Use [BitLy](https://bitly.com) to shorten the URL
   * Paste the shortened URL into the google doc where it says @todo

1. Start the livestream.

1. Talk through the agenda one item at a time.
   * Ask if anyone else has additional updates or questions as you go
   * At the end of the meeting, ask if anyone has anything else to add

1. Stop the livestream.

1. Update the YouTube event title
   * Choose the most memorable thing about the meeting, and add it to the meeting title.
   * For example: “Backdrop weekly 3/13” becomes  “Backdrop Weekly 3/31 (redirect + project browser are near completion!)”

That’s it!!! :)

## Things you don’t have to worry about:

* Creating the meeting agenda
  - It was started the week before, and only needs to be updated
* Creating the “event” on YouTUbe
  - It was created the week before, and the link should be correct in the agenda
* Tweeting about the meeting
  - Tweets have been previously scheduled
