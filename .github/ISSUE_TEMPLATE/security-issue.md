**Please do not use this issue queue to report security issues**

If you believe you may have discovered a security issue with Backdrop CMS,
contact the Backdrop Security Team directly at security@backdropcms.org. In
order to keep everyone safe, we manage security issues separately in a private
repository. So please refrain from publicly blogging, or tweeting about it until
the issue has been resolved.
